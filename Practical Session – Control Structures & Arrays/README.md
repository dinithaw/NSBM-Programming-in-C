Programming with C Language
Practical Session – Control Structures & Arrays

1. Write a program to input an item number, description, price of a product, quantity, and display item number, description with the total price 


Total price = price of a product * quantity

2. Write a program to an input birth year of a student and display the student is a ‘Teenager’ or ‘Not a Teenager’.

3. Display each of the following number series using 1. While 2. Do while and 3. For loops

    a. 1 2 3 4 …………..100
    b. 50 45 40 …………...5
    c. -2 -4 -6 ……………… -20

4. Modify the program in Question 2 to display the ‘Teenager’ count of 10 students. (Use while loop)

5.  Allow the user to input a series of numbers terminates when the user enters either ‘N’ or ‘n’ and display the running total (Sum of all the entered numbers). (Use do-while loop)

6. Input 10 numbers and display the total count of odd, even numbers in the entered number series. (Use for loop)

7. Declare a Single dimensional array with 10 elements. Input the values to the array and find   the followings;
    I. Minimum value
    II. Maximum value
    III. Average value
    IV. Reverse order of values

8.  Declare two 3 x 3 square matrices and display the matrix sum.
The following illustration shows the process of calculating the matrix sum. The values are used as samples.
