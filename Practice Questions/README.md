1. Define a function called hypotenuse that calculates the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle when the other two sides are given. Use this function in a program to determine the length of the hypotenuse for each of the following triangles. The function should take two arguments of type double and return the hypotenuse as a double. 

2. Write a function integerPower(base, exponent) that returns the value of baseexponent For example, integerPower( 3, 4 ) = 3 * 3 * 3 * 3. Assume that exponent is a positive, nonzero integer, and base is an integer. Function integerPower should use for to control the calculation. Do not use any math library functions.


3. Write a program that inputs a series of integers and passes them one at a time to function even, which uses the remainder operator to determine if an integer is even. The function should take an integer argument and return 1 if the integer is even and 0 otherwise. 


4. Implement the following integer functions: 
    a) Function celsius returns the Celsius equivalent of a Fahrenheit temperature.
    b) Function fahrenheit returns the Fahrenheit equivalent of a Celsius temperature.
    c) Use these functions to write a program that prints charts showing the Fahrenheit equivalents of all Celsius temperatures from 0 to 100 degrees, and the Celsius equivalents of all Fahrenheit temperatures from 32 to 212 degrees. Print the outputs in a neat tabular format that minimizes the number of lines of output while remaining readable.

5. Write a function that displays the smallest of three floating-point numbers
