# Programming with C Language 
Tutorial 07 â€“ Functions in C Language

    1. Write a function that will read 2 numbers and calculate and display sum and difference.
    
    2. Write a function that accepts 2 numbers as parameters and calculate and display sum and difference.
    
    3. Write a function that accepts 2 whole numbers as parameters and calculate and return the product.
    
    4. Write a function that accepts 2 whole numbers as parameters and calculate and return the quotient.
    
    5. Write a function to read 2 numbers and display the sum. Call this function from the main function several times.
    
    6. Write a function which accepts 2 integers as parameters and display the sum, difference and product using a single printf statement.
    
    7. Write a function which accepts an integer and a float value as parameters and return the product as a double value. Display the result from the main function.
    
    8. Give the function header for each of the following functions.
      a. Function hypotenuse that takes two double-precision floating-point arguments, side1 and side2, and returns a double-precision floating-point result.
      b. Function smallest that takes three integers, x, y, z, and returns an integer. 
      c. Function instructions that does not receive any arguments and does not return a value. [Note: Such functions are commonly used to display instructions to a user.]
      d. Function intToFloat that takes an integer argument, number, and returns a floatingpoint result.
